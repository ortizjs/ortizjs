### Hi there, I'm, Jon! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Ex-Meta Software Engineer currently looking for new and exciting opportunities. I have experience developing full-stack web applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Hack, React, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript, Python, HTML5, and CSS3. I have worked at both, start-up and large company levels, and know what it is like being part of a large team with a lot of moving pieces and being part of a small close-knit team where everyone is expected to wear many hats.
